## Overview
Sharifah Food is a food processing company that specialises in the ready meals market. Over the years, Sharifah Food had to manually take orders from its customer through WhatsApp and record the sales data in Excel sheets. Nevertheless, it was discovered that it became difficult to keep track of all sales, orders, and inventory as the company grew. Therefore, this project aims to implement a web-based computerised inventory management system that helps the company streamline the inventory management process.

#### Multi-level Marketing System
Sharifah Food applies Multi-level Marketing (MLM) system to sell its products. The customers can apply as **agents** or **dropshippers** to promote and sell the company's products by purchasing the products at discounts. For instance, an agent and a dropshipper can receive 30 percent and 20 percent discounts, respectively, if they order a large quantity of products.
